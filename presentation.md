## Planning :dog2: 

Split into several parts: 
* User stories
* Quick mockup of the website
* Setting out the file architecture
* Figuring out what API we want to use, and testing them out.

## Using the API :rabbit: 

- make sure you're using the right API!
- read the documentation and check your code!
- feature requests

### Difference between SPA , static site and dynamic pages: :hotdog:

### Jack :dog2: 
- So many ways to skin a ~~cat~~ ~~dog~~ potato
- Abstraction and modularisation
- className.toggle()
- A little CSS goes a long way


---

### Tom :hotdog: 

- How the SPA communicates with the browser, and how it deffers from static sites or dynamic pages

- debugging

- wish did tests at the time of writing the code, it would have prevented endless debugging


---

## What went well

1. `See my doggo` function 🐰
 ```Javascript
 function dogToggle() {
 const dogs = document.querySelectorAll(".dog__card");
 dogs.forEach((dog) => {
    dog.classList.toggle("dog--hidden");
  });
  }
  ```
---

2. Debugging
3. Working together as a team

# Week 8 SGC

## Stop


## Go
- Take breaks when debugging 
- Modularising and abstracting from the start
- Try other solutions, besides tutorial (?)
- Use next week to re-energise

## Continue
 - Swap pairs
 - Being an awesome artist
 - mobbing done right ( just enough and when neccessary )
 - Great comunication
 - Great clarity on issues


# Minutes

## Go
### Take breaks when debugging
Liz: could have done with a break from time to tim to get clarity
Tom: hard to break free in the moment, but almost always right
Jack: home.js case in point
Tom: could try pomodoro
Jack: could work nicely with 20-20-20 screen rule

### M & A
Jack: would love ot focus on this myself from now on, one thing per function, one page per file
Ina: really helpful
Tom: React works in modules so helpful to think in this way

### Try other suggestions besides tutorials
Tom: Would have been a struggle without tutorial, but we can learn more from exporing things we don't know. Use as base.
Lizzy: Can be difficult to build when unsure of what it is, so find right balance. Still need to follow the steps. How else could we do it?
Tom: Ivan's talk about learning to learn. "The most counterintuitive truth is having a go if you don't know you're right".
Ina: I get obsessed with best practice, so if code doesn't work get stuck without Google.
Tom: relying only on workshops (e.g. Udemy) limits learning time.
Jack: maybe always discount own first idea about how to do something??!
Lizzy: how will projects relate to what we've learned in workshops?
Jack: most mentors seem to have forgotten the course material
Tom: we're being forced to use different technologies so we can get used to new things - every employer will have different software needs.


### Use next week to re-energise
Jack: good to make sure we have energy to do justice to our work in the second half
Tom: The economy is tough and we need to try hard to give ourselves the best chance at getting out first job. It's a balance

## Continue
### Pairing
Ina: so ne=ice to pair with everyone and good balance in coding

### Being an awesome artist
Jack: Great to have a nice looking website, makes a world of difference
Liz: So nice to work with someone who genuinely cares about look and feel of a project
Ina: great to de-stress after coding

### Mobbing done right
Tom: great job mobbing. One week went as wrong as it could before, this was awesome. we kept it brief, high-level

### Great comms
Jack: Nice to trust each other and have each others' backs, say what we want and support each others' learnings.
Tom: Made working on the project a dream
Lizzy: great at listening to opinions and suggestions on code. Great balance in contributions. Willingness to try new things.


### Great issues
Jack: Clear and distinct issues
Lizzy: HackMD helped, writing everything first to examine how they differed with milestones. 
Jack: Separating issues by file helps. It's hard to learn anything from merge conflicts
Lizzy: Make sure you stay diplomatic and team-first mindset.
Tom: Great to avoid merge conflicts, issues were really clear.

### Whackiness
Jack: So fun to bring fun into projects whilst we can.
